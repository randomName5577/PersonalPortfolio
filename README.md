#PersonalPortfolio
Django Code for my personal portfolio that is hosted on www[dot]codingwithjayson[dot]com

I created this website to have a place to store all my projects and tutorials. I always struggle to figure out how to do something then 7 weeks later I struggle trying to do it again. Now that I can post tutorials as blogs, I will always know how to redo that cool thing. The website is an example of my Django framework knowledge as the website was built from scratch. Everyone always spoke about Django and I knew I had to learn it. This website is one of the first projects I created using Django. Feel free to check out the code! Please let me know if you have any suggestions!
