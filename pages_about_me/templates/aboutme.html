            Diesel vs Traditional Diesel</a></h6>
            <p>We designed an experiment to test how good GTL diesel is compared to traditional diesel in terms of
                emissions and performance. All experiments were run using a single cylinder engine attached to a
                dynamometer.
                Our research paper concluding our results was published in the SAE Journal and presented in the
                conference in Detroit.</p></li>

            <p>We built a car to complete in the Shell Eco-Marathon. The Shell Eco-Marathon is an international
                competition to see which student engineering team can design, build and operate the most
                energy-efficient vehicle.
                Since we were the only GTL diesel car, I consider us winners in our category when in reality we were no
                match for the electric powered cars.</p>
